# acl-anthology-search

This is a script to search [ACL Anthology Reference Corpus](https://acl-arc.comp.nus.edu.sg/) in order to track the popularity of topics in NLP conferences throughout the years.

The program is to look within the title and body of the articles for a certain queried term. It plots a diagram showing the changes in the trends within a specified time span.
